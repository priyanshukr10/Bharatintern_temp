üîó Combined Example with Primary Key and Foreign Key
‚úÖ Step 1: Create department table (Primary Key)
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE department (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
dept_id is the Primary Key in department

It must be unique and not null

‚úÖ Step 2: Create employee table (Foreign Key references Primary Key)
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE employee (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    dept_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES department(dept_id)
);
dept_id is a Foreign Key in employee

It links to department.dept_id

Ensures that employees must belong to a valid department

üß™ Sample Data Insertion
üîπ Insert departments:
sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO department (dept_id, dept_name) VALUES
(1, 'Human Resources'),
(2, 'Finance'),
(3, 'IT');
üîπ Insert employees:
sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO employee (emp_id, emp_name, salary, dept_id) VALUES
(101, 'Alice', 50000.00, 1),
(102, 'Bob', 60000.00, 2),
(103, 'Charlie', 55000.00, 3);
‚ö†Ô∏è Example of Foreign Key Violation
Trying this will fail:

sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO employee (emp_id, emp_name, salary, dept_id) 
VALUES (104, 'David', 52000.00, 5);
Because there is no department with dept_id = 5, the Foreign Key constraint blocks it.

üìä Output Example (Join Both Tables)
üîÑ Join to show employee details with department name:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, e.salary, d.dept_name
FROM employee e
JOIN department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
